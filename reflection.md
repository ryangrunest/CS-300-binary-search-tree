# Reflection

The purpose of this code is to implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) for managing and organizing bid data efficiently. The program allows users to load bids from a CSV file, display all bids in sorted order, search for a specific bid by its ID, and remove bids from the tree. The BST structure ensures efficient operations, with average-case time complexities of O(log n) for insertion, search, and deletion. The program also includes a menu-driven interface for user interaction, making it user-friendly and practical for managing large datasets.

To solve the problem, the code employs recursive techniques for tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order), insertion, and deletion. These techniques ensure that the BST maintains its properties while performing operations. Challenges encountered during development included handling edge cases, such as removing nodes with two children or searching for non-existent bids. These challenges were addressed by implementing robust recursive logic and ensuring proper memory management, such as deleting nodes and updating pointers correctly. Overall, the project demonstrates the effective use of data structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems involving data organization and retrieval.
